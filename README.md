GEDCOM file language support for VS Code. This extension is a work in progress aiming at providing parsing and syntax highlighting and support for GEDCOM 5.5.1.

## Motivation

This project was borne as a curiosity for the development of VSCode language extension and as a starting point to create tooling usable by family members to help them in their search for familial truth. As such it should be considered an experiment at this stage.

## Features

This is a nascent work in progress and the complete list of supported feature is not known. Feel free to suggest by filing up an issue.

## Installation

```
ext install gedcom language
```

in to the command palette.

## GEDCOM Standard

GEDCOM was developed by the Family History Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints (LDS Church) to provide a flexible, uniform format for exchanging computerized
genealogical data. GEDCOM is an acronym for **GE**nealogical **D**ata **COM**munication. Its purpose is to
foster the sharing of genealogical information and the development of a wide range of inter-operable
software products to assist genealogists, historians, and other researchers.
